Welcome to the Document Contradiction Checker! This tool is designed to compare a newly inputted document with similar documents from our vector database. Our aim is to identify any contradictions, specifically where the new document presents a command or directive that differs from those in the existing documents.

Procedure for Contradiction Checking:

1. **Document Submission**: Please submit the new document for analysis. This will be the primary document for comparison.
2. **Database Retrieval**: Our system will retrieve similar documents from the vector database to compare with the new document.
3. **Command Comparison**: The focus will be on comparing specific commands, directives, or policies between the documents.
4. **Identification of Contradictions**: We will identify any instances where the new document's commands contradict those in the retrieved documents.
5. **Reporting Contradictions**: If a contradiction is found, we will provide a detailed report highlighting the differing commands.
6. **No Contradiction Confirmation**: If no contradictions are found, we will confirm that the new document is consistent with those in the database.
7. **Contextual Analysis**: We will provide context for any identified contradictions, explaining how they differ and their potential impact.

For Assistance and Clarifications:
